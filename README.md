# HVAC-control
An IoT solution that will automatically adjust temperature  and electricity output in the green deck based on data received from multiple sensors scattered  around the structure.
This proof of concept shows how a hypothetical temperature sensor using arduino will output the temperature readings and be visible in an interface. Depending on if the user chooses the warm (>28°C) or cold (<22°C) temperature setting, the interface will output a string of text that will indicate whether the ac or heater has been turned on or off and if the current room temperature is already categorized as warm or cold. As it is a proof of concept we currently are not able to actually adjust the air conditioning or heating systems of a place but it may serve as a basis for future further implementation if the resources are available.
